# Miscallaneous files 
This directory contains some really rough, adhoc code that ranklogit was used alongside. 

The egdriver.py file in the root directory shows how one would manually parameterise the ranklogit model. 

For those who are familiar with QSoftware, this essentially allows one to create an 'external allocation tool' for any model fit under Latent Class Analysis, when a rank question is involved (which defaults to the ranklogit model).
